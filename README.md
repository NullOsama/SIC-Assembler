# SIC-Assembler

SIC-Assembler Project that assembles a SIC architechure scripts and generates the requared files and records.

```bash
python assembler.py <input script path> <intermediate file path> <listing file path> <object file path>
```
Example: 
```python
python .\assembler.py .\sample_tests\source.asm .\intermediate.mdt .\listing.lst .\object_file.obj
```


It takes the script in the inputfile source and generates the symbol table, program name, program length, ... etc.
